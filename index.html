        <h1>My Website!</h1>
        <p>
          This is mostly just a tool for me to keep track of things I need to
          keep track of. For example, I may put my to do list on here, christmas lists
          for family members, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Naturally, one might think how stupid I am for putting my personal stuff on
          a website that literally anybody can access. You're probably right,
          but frankly, I don't care and anything that I feel I need to keep private will
          not be on here.
