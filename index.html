      <p>I am currently a computer science student at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma.</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>Currently, I am developing WeatherMeme, an Android application that gives you current weather information along with a weather-appropriate meme! It is still in the early stages of development. You can check it out as well as my other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/andrewbeav">Github Page</a></p>

      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>My two biggest interests are currently Android development and Arch Linux. I'm relatively new to Android Development but have been using Linux off and on since I was twelve. I've been using Linux exclusively (No Windows!) since August 2016 and have been using Arch exclusively since December 2016.</p>
